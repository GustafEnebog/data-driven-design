## Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for the bring your own data project option in Predictive Analytics. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly okay to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the `Use this template` button above to get started.

You can safely delete the Template Instructions section of this README.md file and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use.

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

1. Log into your cloud IDE with your GitHub account.

1. On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button

1. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

1. Click Create

1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

1. Open a new terminal and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory, and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

Note that the kernel says Python 3.8.18 as it inherits from the workspace, so it will be Python-3.8.18 as installed by our template. To confirm this, you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked


You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.


## Dataset Content xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size and to have a shorter model training time. If you are doing an image recognition project, we suggest you consider using an image shape that is 100px × 100px or 50px × 50px, to ensure the model meets the performance requirement but is smaller than 100Mb for a smoother push to GitHub. A reasonably sized image set is ~5000 images, but you can choose ~10000 lines for numeric or textual data. 


## Business Requirements
* Describe your business requirements


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

Churnometer
Quick Project Summary
Project Terms & Jargon

A customer is a person who consumes your service or product.
A prospect is a potential customer.
A churned customer is a user who has stopped using your product or service.
This customer has a tenure level, the number of months this person has used our product/service.
Project Dataset

The dataset represents a customer base from a Telco company containing individual customer data on the products and services (like internet type, online security, online backup, tech support), account information (like contract type, payment method, monthly charges) and profile (like gender, partner, dependents).
For additional information, please visit and read the Project README file.
The project has 2 business requirements:

1 - The client is interested in understanding the patterns from the customer base so that the client can learn the most relevant variables that are correlated to a churned customer.
2 - The client is interested to be able to respond quickly to design specifications from customersxxxxx be able to determining ball bark estimates on airplane design parameters, e.g. Wing span, propulsion size and engine type based on specification parameters like performance paramteres like cruise speed, service celing and rate of climb  what ether or not a given prospect will churn. If so, the client is interested to know when. In addition, the client is interested in learning from which cluster this prospect will belong in the customer base. Based on that, present potential factors that could maintain and/or bring the prospect to a non-churnable cluster.

## Business Requirements
The ficticous company *Data Driven Design* consist of data practitioners with the combined skillset of Vehicle Design and Machine Learning.

<img src="image_readme/data_driven_design_logo_5.png" alt="Logo for Data Driven Design " width=/>

The fictitious client is the Conceptual Design Department of a new fledgling airplane manufacturer who wish to build design tools to quickly asses the feasibility of customer inquires (specifications) for new airplane performance as well as generate start values for the conceptual design process.

 come up with ball park estimates on conceptual airplane design for specifications submitted by their customers. an ML algorithm from a data practitioner shows the patterns between design and performance features and is able to to predict performance based on design features as well as (the other way around) to predict what values design features need to take on to reach certain performance targets all based on the dataset provided. The aim is to maximise xxxxx.

**Business Requirement 1** - The client is interested in understanding which Performance features affect the most by changes in the design parameters

**Business Requirement 2** - The client is interested in predicting the necessary values that the Design parameters need to take on in order to reach certain performance targets.

**Business Requirement 3** - The client is also interested in categorising airplanes based on engine type (jet, piston or propjet) (supervised learning)

**Business Requirement 4** - The client is also interested to see if the airplanes cluster into distinct groups based their features (unsupervised learning)



The client (a company's HR department) requested a ML algorithm from a data practitioner to predict attrition based on the dataset provided. The aim is to minimize attrition rates.

Business Requirement 1 - The client is interested in understanding the main factors leading to attrition
Business Requirement 2 - The client is interested in predicting whether a certain employee will decide to leave the company




Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high risk of disease need early detection and management. A fictional organisation has requested a data practitioner to analyse a dataset of patients from a number of different hospitals in order to determine what factors can be attributed to a high risk of disease and whether patient data can accurately predict risk of heart disease.

Business Requirement 1 - The client is interested in which attributes correlate most closely with heart disease, ie what are the most common risk factors?

Business Requirement 2 - The client is interested in using patient data to predict whether or not a patient is at risk of heart disease.





As a Data Analyst from Code Institute Consulting, you are requested by the Telco division to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to a Telecom corporation. This client has a substantial customer base and is interested in managing churn levels and understanding how the sales team could better interact with prospects. The client has shared the data.

- 1 - The client is interested in understanding the patterns from the customer base so that the client can learn the most relevant variables correlated to a churned customer.
- 2 - The client is interested in determining whether or not a given prospect will churn. If so, the client is interested to know when. In addition, the client is interested in learning from which cluster this prospect will belong in the customer base. Based on that, present potential factors that could maintain and/or bring the prospect to a non-churnable cluster.





The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of brain tumors from medical images. The model should assist medical professionals in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses, and the patients should benefit from the earlier detection and the tempestive and appropriate treatment planning.

Key Stakeholders, therefore should be: - Medical professionals - Patients - Hospitals and healthcare facilities

Requirements:

Accuracy: The model should have a high accuracy rate in classifying brain images as either tumor (1) or non-tumor (0).
Interpretability: The model should provide some insight into the prediction process and the relevant feature importance in that process, so the medical professionals could understand the relevant discoveries.
Scalability: The solution should be scalable to handle a large volume of brain images from various sources.
Speed: The model should be able to make predictions in real-time so that the reliable quick diagnosis could be make.
Privacy: The meticulous attention should be given in the data collection in order to guarantee the patient's anonymity and consent for the data usage.
In short, the project businsess objectives are as follows:

The client is interested in having an analysis of the visual difference between the MRI brain scan of healthy and brain with tumor. The analysis should provide, among other things: the average image and variability per label in the data set.
The client is interested in having a functional and reliable ML model that could predict the presence or absence of the tumor from the image of the MRI brain scan. For the realisation of this business objective, a deep learning pipeline should be developed with the binary classification of the MRI images. The said pipeline should be also deployed.
The Streamlit Dashboard will be developed that will finally serve as a platform for the presentation of the results of first two business objectives, together with the interactive implementation of the prediction of the unseen MRI image.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
- 1 - We suspect customers are churning with low tenure levels.
	- A Correlation study can help in this investigation
- 2 - A customer survey showed our customers appreciate Fibre Optic.
	- A Correlation study can help in this investigation


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
- **Business Requirement 1:** Data Visualization and Correlation study
	- We will inspect the data related to the customer base.
	- We will conduct a correlation study (Pearson and Spearman) to understand better how the variables are correlated to Churn.
	- We will plot the main variables against Churn to visualize insights.

- **Business Requirement 2:** Classification, Regression, Cluster and Data Analysis
	- We want to predict if a prospect will churn or not. We want to build a binary classifier.
	- We want to predict the tenure level for a prospect that is expected to churn. We want to build a regression model or change the ML task to classification depending on the regressor performance.
	- We want to cluster similar customers to predict from which cluster a prospect will belong.
	- We want to understand a cluster profile to present potential options to maintain or bring the prospect to a non-churnable cluster.




## ML Business Case

### Predict Churn
#### Classification Model
- We want an ML model to predict if a prospect will churn based on historical data from the customer base, which doesn't include tenure and total charges since these values are zero for a prospect. The target variable is categorical and contains 2-classes. We consider a **classification model**. It is a supervised model, a 2-class, single-label, classification model output: 0 (no churn), 1 (yes churn)
- Our ideal outcome is to provide our sales team with reliable insight into onboarding customers with a higher sense of loyalty.
- The model success metrics are
	- at least 80% Recall for Churn, on train and test set 
	- The ML model is considered a failure if:
		- after 3 months of usage, more than 30% of newly onboarded customers churn (it is an indication that the offers are not working or the model is not detecting potential churners)
		- Precision for no Churn is lower than 80% on train and test set. (We don't want to offer a free discount to many non-churnable prospects)
- The model output is defined as a flag, indicating if a prospect will churn or not and the associated probability of churning. If the prospect is online, the prospect will have already provided the input data via a form. If the prospect talks to a salesperson, the salesperson will interview to gather the input data and feed it into the App. The prediction is made on the fly (not in batches).
- Heuristics: Currently, there is no approach to predict churn on prospects
- The training data to fit the model comes from the Telco Customer. This dataset contains about 7 thousand customer records.
	- Train data - target: Churn; features: all other variables, but tenure, total charges and customerID

### Predict Tenure
#### Regression Model
- We want an ML model to predict tenure levels, in months, for a prospect expected to churn. A target variable is a discrete number. We consider a **regression model**, which is supervised and uni-dimensional.
- Our ideal outcome is to provide our sales team with reliable insight into onboarding customers with a higher sense of loyalty.
- The model success metrics are
	- At least 0.7 for R2 score, on train and test set
	- The ML model is considered a failure if:
		- after 12 months of usage, the model's predictions are 50% off more than 30% of the time. Say, a prediction is >50% off if predicted 10 months and the actual value was 2 months.
- The output is defined as a continuous value for tenure in months. It is assumed that this model will predict tenure if the Predict Churn Classifier predicts 1 (yes for churn). If the prospect is online, the prospect will have already provided the input data via a form. If the prospect talks to a salesperson, the salesperson will interview to gather the input data and feed it into the App. The prediction is made on the fly (not in batches).
- Heuristics: Currently, there is no approach to predict the tenure levels for a prospect.
- The training data to fit the model comes from the Telco Customer. This dataset contains about 7 thousand customer records.
	- Train data - filter data where Churn == 1, then drop the Churn variable. Target: tenure; features: all other variables, but total charges and customerID


#### Classification Model
- Before the analysis, we visualized a Regressor pipeline to predict Churn; however, the performance didn’t meet the requirement (at least 0.7 for R2 score, on train and test set)
- We used a technique to convert the ML task from Regression to Classification. We discretized the target into 3 ranges: <4 months, 4-20 months and +20 months. 
- The classification pipeline can detect a prospect that would likely churn in less than four months and a prospect that would likely churn in more than 20 months.
- A target variable is categorical and contains 3 classes. We consider a **classification model**, which is supervised and uni-dimensional.
- Our ideal outcome is to provide our sales team with reliable insight into onboarding customers with a higher sense of loyalty.
- The model success metrics are
	- At least 0.8 Recall for <4 months, on train and test set
	- The ML model is considered a failure if:
		- after 3 months of usage, more than 30% of customers that were expected to churn in <4 months do not churn
- The output is defined as a class, which maps to a range of tenure in months. It is assumed that this model will predict tenure if the Predict Churn Classifier predicts 1 (yes for churn). If the prospect is online, the prospect will have already provided the input data via a form. If the prospect talks to a salesperson, the salesperson will interview to gather the input data and feed it into the App. The prediction is made on the fly (not in batches).
- Heuristics: Currently, there is no approach to predict the tenure levels for a prospect.
- The training data to fit the model comes from the Telco Customer. This dataset contains about 7 thousand customer records.
	- Train data - filter data where Churn == 1, then drop the Churn variable. Target: tenure; features: all other variables, but total charges and customerID


### Cluster Analysis
#### Clustering Model
- We want an ML model to cluster similar customer behaviour. It is an unsupervised model.
- Our ideal outcome is to provide our sales team with reliable insight into onboarding customers with a higher sense of loyalty.
- The model success metrics are
	- at least 0.45 for the average silhouette score
	- The ML model is considered a failure if the model suggests from more than 15 clusters (might become too difficult to interpret in practical terms)
- The output is defined as an additional column appended to the dataset. This column represents the cluster's suggestions. It is a categorical and nominal variable represented by numbers starting at 0.
- Heuristics: Currently, there is no approach to grouping similar customers
- The training data to fit the model comes from the Telco Customer. This dataset contains about 7 thousand customer records.
	- Train data - features: all variables, but customerID, TotalCharges, Churn, and tenure 


## Dashboard Design (Streamlit App User Interface)

### Page 1: Quick project summary
- Quick project summary
	- Project Terms & Jargon
	- Describe Project Dataset
	- State Business Requirements

### Page 2: Customer Base Churn Study
- Before the analysis, we knew we wanted this page to answer business requirement 1, but we couldn't know in advance which plots would need to be displayed.
- After data analysis, we agreed with stakeholders that the page will: 
	- State business requirement 1
	- Checkbox: data inspection on customer base (display the number of rows and columns in the data, and display the first ten rows of the data)
	- Display the most correlated variables to churn and the conclusions
	- Checkbox: Individual plots showing the churn levels for each correlated variable 
	- Checkbox: Parallel plot using Churn and correlated variables 

### Page 3: Prospect Churnometer
- State business requirement 2
- Set of widgets inputs, which relates to the prospect profile. Each set of inputs is related to a given ML task to predict prospect Churn, Tenure and Cluster.
- "Run predictive analysis" button that serves the prospect data to our ML pipelines and predicts if the prospect will churn or not, if so, when. It also shows to which cluster the prospect belongs and the cluster's profile. For the churn and tenure predictions, the page will inform the associated probability for churning and tenure level.

### Page 4: Project Hypothesis and Validation
- Before the analysis, we knew we wanted this page to describe each project hypothesis, the conclusions, and how we validated each. After the data analysis, we can report that:
- 1 - We suspect customers are churning with low tenure levels
	- Correct. The correlation study at Churned Customer Study supports that.
- 2 -  A customer survey showed our customers appreciate Fibre Optic.
	- A churned user typically has Fiber Optic, as demonstrated by a Churned Customer Study. The insight will be taken to the survey team for further discussions and investigations.
